;PROBLEM:
;
;DESIGN function that consumes a string and determines whether its length is
;less than 5.  Follow the HtDF recipe and leave behind commented out versions 
;of the stub and template.

;String -> Boolean
;Takes in a string and returns true if its length is less than 5
(check-expect (less-than-five "hello") false)
(check-expect (less-than-five "hellos") false)
(check-expect (less-than-five "ello") true)

;(define (less-than-five str) true) ;stub
;(define (less-than-five str) ;template
;  (... str)) 

(define (less-than-five str)
  (< (string-length str) 5))
