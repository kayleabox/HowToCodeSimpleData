; PROBLEM:
; 
; DESIGN function that consumes a string and determines whether its length is
; less than 5.  Follow the HtDF recipe and leave behind commented out versions 
; of the stub and template.
; 

;; String -> Boolean
;; Takes in a string and returns true if its length is less than 5
(check-expect (less-than-five "hello") false)
(check-expect (less-than-five "hellos") false)
(check-expect (less-than-five "ello") true)


; (define (less-than-five str) true) ;stub
; (define (less-than-five str) ;template
;   (... str))
