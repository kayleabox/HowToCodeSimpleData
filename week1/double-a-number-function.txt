; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a function that consumes a number and produces twice that number. 
; Call your function double. Follow the HtDF recipe and leave behind commented 
; out versions of the stub and template.
; 

;; Number -> Number
; this function takes in a number and returns that number multiplied by 2
(check-expect (double 3) 6)
(check-expect (double 4) 8)
(check-expect (double -5) -10)

;(define (double n) 0) ;stub
;(define (double n) ;template
;  (... n))

(define (double n)
  (* 2 n))
