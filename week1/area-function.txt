;; PROBLEM:

;; DESIGN a function called area that consumes the length of one side 
;; of a square and produces the area of the square.

;; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.

;; Leave behind commented out versions of the stub and template.

;; Number -> Number
;; given length of a side of a square return the area of the square
(check-expect (area 3) 9)
(check-expect (area 6.1) (* 6.1 6.1))


; (define (area s) 0) ;stub
; (define (area s)    ;template
;   (... s))

(define (area s)
  (* s s))
